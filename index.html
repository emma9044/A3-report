      <h4>The structure</h4>
			<p>The structure of this web-based charity went through 3 rough iterations on paper before a final sitemap was created digitally.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The initial sketched iteration</li>
        <figure>
				  <img src="id/2.jpg" alt="iteration 1 image" width=100% >
          <figcaption>This is the first iteration sketch.</figcaption>

				  <img src="id/5.jpg" alt="iteration 2 image" width=100% >
        </figure>
        <p>Above are some design element, I will consider use information bar , search bar, bottoms and pictures to form my deisgn.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>"A picture is worth a thousand words" is extremely relevant when it comes to mood boards. Most people are visual learners, avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings caused by too much text. The moodboard can clearly and quickly understand the design style and goal.</p>

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>	
      <h4>Homepage</h4>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images2.1.jpg" alt="homepage sketches" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is some homepage sketch.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/A.jpg" alt="user profile" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is record of mini interview.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Moving on to the layout design, I mainly </p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="sketch/V6.jpg" alt="homepage sketches1" width=100% >
          <figcaption>This is the first homepage sketch.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is the first sketch and I just simply putting information and functionality into the interface without any design structure in mind.</p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="sketch/V5.jpg" alt="homepage sketches2" width=100% >
          <figcaption>This is the second homepage sketch.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In the second version,according the feedback of interview, I set the functionality to the usual information bar and putting it at the top in the next step.</p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="sketch/V4.jpg" alt="homepage sketches3" width=100% >
          <figcaption>This is the third homepage sketch.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The information bar is relatively small, it is difficult for users to quickly capture the key information and I used the combination of graphics and text to put the four functions separately on the four corresponding pictures.</p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="sketch/V23.jpg" alt="homepage sketches4" width=100% >
          <figcaption>This is the forth homepage sketch.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> There is always a problem, large text messages will cause user disgust, so in the homepage as much as possible to use pictures or simple information structure instead of large text.I use search bar instead of heavy text.</p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="sketch/V8.jpg" alt="homepage sketches5" width=100% >
          <figcaption>This is the final homepage sketch.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>  Considering that new users don't know much </p>

          <figcaption>This is the sketch of adpot a pet.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The search function was added to the feature bar to make it easy for users to quickly filter the desired results from the large number of adoptable pets.</p>
      <h4>Forster care</h4>
      <figure>
				  <img src="sketch/V11.jpg" alt="forster care sketches" width=100% >
          <figcaption>This is the sketch of forster care.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>List selection is added to this bar.Being a foster care provider is mostly between cities, it is a good choice to apply by district.</p>
      <h4>Report cruelty</h4>

          <figcaption>This is the sketch of report cruelty.</figcaption>

      <p>It's mostly text and information and there's no special design.</p>

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>A wireframe is a continuation of a sketch, not as elaborate as a mock up but with all the elements of the site. It allows us to quickly build ideas and find and solve problems before the final design.</p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      <h4>Homepage 1</h4>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images7.jpg" alt="homepage wireframe1" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is a wairframe of homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The wireframes of the first home page redesign from the third sketch, using arclinks as "powerful visual symbols"(Fessenden (2018)) so that parts of the interface need to be dropped down to see, otherwise they will not be able to get the full information, adding to the interaction with the user.</p>
      <blockquote>"The design of curves can be confusing."</blockquote>
      <h4>Homepage 2</h4>
      <figure>
          <img src="id/images8.jpg" alt="homepage wireframe2" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is a wairframe of homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
			<p>In the second wireframing iteration of the home page, the original image link function was retained, but considering that several functions were side-by-side and there was no progression, the arc might cause confusion to users, so the arc link form was dropped. According to the "less is more" mentioned by Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe in 1947, I replaced the original text introduction paragraphs with large pictures to show recent events or news. Simple words coupled with screen-filled pictures give a sense of minimalism, allowing users to feel relaxed and comfortable visually.</p>
      <h4>What we do</h4>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images9.jpg" alt="what we do homepage" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is a wairframe of waht we do homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
			<p>In what we do homepage is still adopt the drop-down menu and briefly describes each content, the user can scroll to the bottom. This scrolling was justified by research that found a majority of users scroll on a website to some extent, and a very significant number scrol to the bottom (Schwartz & Yavilevich, 2006). According to the survey so that the user can be roughly understanding to the key information from an overview of the content and don't have to jump at the same time provide a jump interface, can be better to understand the user to provide comprehensive information institutions. </p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images10.jpg" alt="what we do pages" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is a wairframe of waht we do pages.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After clicking learn more bottom, it will jump to corresponding interface. Above are the wireframes of these interfaces which are all textual introductions.</p>
      <h4>Support us</h4>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images11.jpg" alt="support us homepage" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is a wairframe of support us homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images10.jpg" alt="support us pages" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is a wairframe of support us pages.</figcaption>
      </figure>
			<p>Consider the most of features in the categories of support us that do not require text interpretation, such as donations that require only direct payment or transfer.Therefore, it adopts the form of picture to give the user a visual impact, and enters the jump interface to fill in or obtain information by clicking the picture. In addition to the donation interface needs to jump infterface from the amount to donor information and then payment method. Other function pages are mostly text.</p>
      <h4>Adopt a pet</h4>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images12.jpg" alt="adpot a pet homepage" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is a wairframe of adpot a pet homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images13.jpg" alt="adpot a pet homepage" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is a wairframe of adpot a pet homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The adoption interface uses the search function to accurately and quickly screen the animals that meet the requirements for users. For example by region or pet species. After searching or clicking on the animal category, it will be redirected to the second interface for adoption. With the pet pictures and basic information, users can get the general information they want without having to jump to the interface.</p>
      <h4>Foster care and Report cruelty</h4>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images14.2.jpg" alt="Report cruelty homepage" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is a wairframe of report cruelty homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images14.1.jpg" alt="Foster care  homepage" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is a wairframe of roster care.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Both the foster care provider and the report are mainly to provide information and fill in information for the user. Similar design elements and concepts were adopted earlier. There is nothing special in the overall design of the interface, which is consistent with the previous design.</p>
			<!-- Use the figure element for embedding images and iframes with annotations/captions -->
      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>Mock up is a one-to-one restore of the final site and can be used to test users before the site is built.</p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images15.1.jpg" alt="homepage" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of RSPCA homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Finally the main interface as well as wireframes, put all the pictures with a layer of pale gray enables users to see the words above clearly. The above of sit is the latest news and user can Click left or right to browse other information.User can scrol the information below, or click on the above suspension bar to jump into the interface. The only difference from the wireframes is that the donation function is placed under the logo to do a shortcut key. The main source of income for charity websites is donations. Therefore, the donation function should be more visible and quick.</p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images16.jpg" alt="role page" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of what we do homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images15.2.jpg" alt="role page" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of role page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Several functions are arranged in slightly different ways on a phone than on a computer. The vertical arrangement on a phone is different from the horizontal arrangement on a computer, depending on the direction of the screen when the phone is being used.Users scroll to get more information about the organization, and images force users to scroll, which means they stay on the site longer. Add a white translucent rectangle below the title to make the title clearer. Due to the limitation of the interface size of the mobile phone, the floating information bar of the computer is changed to a rectangle that can be scaled. Click it and the information bar will pop up.</p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images22.jpg" alt="support us homepage" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of support us homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images17.jpg" alt="support page" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of donate money page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images18.1.jpg" alt="what we do page" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of donate goods page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images18.2.jpg" alt="what we do page" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of become a volunteer page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images18.3.jpg" alt="what we do page" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of make a bequest.</figcaption>
      </figure>
       <p>In this interface, it is slightly different from wireframing. I enlarged the image to fill the entire interface with four images to avoid the problem of too much white space to capture information. The donation interface prompts the user with circular steps, guides the user to fill in the amount of donation and select the frequency of donation, and then completes the online payment after leaving personal information.</p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images19.jpg" alt="adopt homepage" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of adopt a pet homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images20.jpg" alt="adopt page" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of adopt a dog page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The  pet adoption page allows the user to select area and species to filter in accordance with user requirements of pet. After the selection, it will show pictures of dogs with simple information of them below the picture. Users can click on the photo to get pet details, this design can maximize saving user time.</p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images21.1.jpg" alt="report cruelty homepage" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of report cruelty homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="id/images21.2.jpg" alt="foster care homepage" width=100%>
          <figcaption>This is the mock up of foster care homepage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The interface for reporting and foster care have similar design elements as before. Reporting can only be accessed through the information bar at the top. Considering this is an emergency, the blue color of the website is used as the background color of this function at the top.</p>
